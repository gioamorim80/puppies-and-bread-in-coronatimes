# puppies-and-bread-in-coronatimes

This project uses NLP and does hypothesis testing in wether people are adopting more pets and making more homemade bread during the Coronavirus pandemic.

Even since we had been advised to stay at home in my state of New Jersey, I've been noticing from my social circle and over social media channels an increase on two very specific things: people getting new puppies, and people making bread at home (particularly sourdough). I was curious to know if this is really a trend or just my personal perception, so I decided to apply some hypothesis testing to verify it. 

To do this, I will look into Twitter over time - before and after the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic. More specifically I'll look over the period from March 21, when NJ governor gave the "stay at home" order. I will use Natural Language Processing to compare the prevalence of terms related to both pet adoption and bread making, and compare the incidences over the two periods, using hypothesis testing to verify if the difference that migth appear are indeed statistically significant.
