# puppies-and-bread-in-coronatimes

This project uses NLP to analyze the effect of Coronavirus lockdowns on people adopting new pets and baking bread at home.

Even since we had been advised to stay at home in my state of New Jersey, I've been noticing from my social circle and over social media channels an increase on two very specific things: people getting new puppies, and people making bread at home (particularly sourdough). I was curious to know if this is really a trend or just my personal perception, so I decided to apply natural language processing and data analysis to verify it. 

I'm scrapping data from Twitter. More to come soon!
